I am a Data Scientist and AI Mentor with a strong background in **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**.
Currently, I work as a **Research Assistant** at Staffordshire University (Remote), focusing on **Medical Image Analysis** and Deep Learning models for healthcare decision support.

Previously, I served as a Data Scientist at **NICICO** (National Iranian Copper Industries Co.), where I deployed computer vision systems for industrial safety. I am also ranked as a **Top 4 Data Scientist in Iran** (Favikon) and hold the **Kaggle Master** tier.

My research interests include:
- **Medical AI:** Segmentation & diagnostics (e.g., Left Ventricle Segmentation).
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Fine-tuning and RAG systems.
- **Computer Vision:** Object detection and tracking in industrial environments.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
